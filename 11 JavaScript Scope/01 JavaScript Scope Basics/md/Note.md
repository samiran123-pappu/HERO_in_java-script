# JavaScript Scope Basics

Scope means variable visibility.

JavaScript has 3 main scopes:

- Global scope
- Function scope
- Block scope

Key points:

- Variables declared outside functions/blocks are global.
- Variables declared inside a function are local to that function.
- `let` and `const` are block scoped.
- `var` is not block scoped.
