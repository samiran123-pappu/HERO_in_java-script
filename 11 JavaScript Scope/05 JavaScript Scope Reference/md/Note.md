# JavaScript Scope Reference

Track: **11 JavaScript Scope**

## Core Idea

- Scope defines where a variable is visible and where it can be safely used.
- Hoisting affects declarations; strict mode prevents many silent JavaScript mistakes.

## Syntax Patterns

- `let` and `const` are block-scoped. `var` is function-scoped.
- Use `"use strict";` at script/function top to enable strict mode rules.

## Common Mistakes

- Assuming `var` is block scoped, or using variables before declaration and hitting TDZ errors.

## How To Study This Topic

- Read the HTML example heading and predict the expected result first.
- Run the `.js` file and verify each variable/value transition.
- Open the `.html` file and compare visible output with your prediction.
- Change one line and rerun to observe cause/effect clearly.

## Quick Self-Check

- Can I explain this topic in one sentence without reading code?
- Can I write a minimal working example from memory?
- Can I name one common bug and how to avoid it?
## Learning Path

- Prerequisite: **JavaScript Use Strict**
- Next Topic: **None (last topic in this track)**

## Mini Exercises

1. Write one small code example from this topic without looking at notes.
2. Modify one existing example so it fails, then fix it and explain why.
3. Explain this topic in 3-5 lines as if teaching a beginner.
