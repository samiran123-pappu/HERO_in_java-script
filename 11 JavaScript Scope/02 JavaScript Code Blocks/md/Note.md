# JavaScript Code Blocks

A block is code inside `{}`.

- In `if`, `for`, `while`, and functions, blocks group statements.
- `let` and `const` inside a block are only visible in that block.
- Standalone blocks can be used for temporary calculations.

This prevents global-scope pollution and naming collisions.
