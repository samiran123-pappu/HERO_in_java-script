# 05 JavaScript Conditionals

## Making Decisions

Conditional statements are used to perform different actions based on different conditions. Without them, code would always run the same way from top to bottom.

## 📚 Topics

1.  **[01 If Else](./01%20If%20Else/index.html)**
    *   `if`, `else`, and `else if`.
    *   Executing code only when a condition is true.

2.  **02 Switch**
    *   Selecting one of many code blocks to execute.
    *   Cleaner than many `else if` statements.

3.  **03 Ternary**
    *   The conditional operator `? :`.
    *   Writing one-line if/else statements.

4.  **04 Booleans**
    *   Understanding `true` and `false`.
    *   Truthy and Falsy values (e.g., `0`, `""`, `null`).

## 🔑 Key Takeaway

- Use `if` for ranges or complex conditions.
- Use `switch` for specific value checks.
- Use **Ternary** for simple value assignments.
- Be careful of "Falsy" values like `0` or empty strings.
