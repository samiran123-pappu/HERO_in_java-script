# JavaScript if else

Track: **05 JavaScript Conditionals**

## Core Idea

- Conditional flow runs different code paths based on true/false results.
- Choose the simplest construct for readability (`if`, `switch`, ternary where short).

## Syntax Patterns

- Ternary format: `condition ? whenTrue : whenFalse`.
- `switch` compares with strict equality and usually needs `break`.

## Common Mistakes

- Overusing nested ternaries or forgetting `break` in switch cases.

## How To Study This Topic

- Read the HTML example heading and predict the expected result first.
- Run the `.js` file and verify each variable/value transition.
- Open the `.html` file and compare visible output with your prediction.
- Change one line and rerun to observe cause/effect clearly.

## Quick Self-Check

- Can I explain this topic in one sentence without reading code?
- Can I write a minimal working example from memory?
- Can I name one common bug and how to avoid it?
## Learning Path

- Prerequisite: **JavaScript if**

## Mini Exercises

1. Write one small code example from this topic without looking at notes.
2. Modify one existing example so it fails, then fix it and explain why.
3. Explain this topic in 3-5 lines as if teaching a beginner.
