# JavaScript Array Methods

Track: **14 JavaScript Arrays**

## Core Idea

- Arrays are ordered collections with numeric indexes starting at 0.
- Most array methods return new arrays; some mutate the original array.

## Syntax Patterns

- Iteration patterns: `for`, `for...of`, `.forEach()`, `.map()`, `.filter()`.
- Search patterns: `.indexOf()`, `.find()`, `.findIndex()`, `.includes()`.

## Common Mistakes

- Forgetting which methods mutate (`push`, `pop`, `sort`) vs return new arrays (`map`, `filter`).

## How To Study This Topic

- Read the HTML example heading and predict the expected result first.
- Run the `.js` file and verify each variable/value transition.
- Open the `.html` file and compare visible output with your prediction.
- Change one line and rerun to observe cause/effect clearly.

## Quick Self-Check

- Can I explain this topic in one sentence without reading code?
- Can I write a minimal working example from memory?
- Can I name one common bug and how to avoid it?

## Mini Exercises

1. Pick one array method and explain whether it mutates the original array.
2. Rewrite one array example using a different method (`map` vs `forEach`, etc.).
3. Create a small array challenge and solve it in two ways.
