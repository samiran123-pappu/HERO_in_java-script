// Access the Full Array
// With JavaScript, the full array can be accessed by referring to the array name:


const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
console.log(cars);

// Note
// Arrays use numbered indexes. Array indexes start with 0. This means that [0] is the first element, [1] is the second element, and so on.
