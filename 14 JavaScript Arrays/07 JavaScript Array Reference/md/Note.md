# JavaScript Array Reference

Track: **14 JavaScript Arrays**

## Core Idea

- Arrays are ordered collections with numeric indexes starting at 0.
- Most array methods return new arrays; some mutate the original array.

## Syntax Patterns

- Iteration patterns: `for`, `for...of`, `.forEach()`, `.map()`, `.filter()`.
- Search patterns: `.indexOf()`, `.find()`, `.findIndex()`, `.includes()`.

## Common Mistakes

- Forgetting which methods mutate (`push`, `pop`, `sort`) vs return new arrays (`map`, `filter`).

## How To Study This Topic

- Read the HTML example heading and predict the expected result first.
- Run the `.js` file and verify each variable/value transition.
- Open the `.html` file and compare visible output with your prediction.
- Change one line and rerun to observe cause/effect clearly.

## Quick Self-Check

- Can I explain this topic in one sentence without reading code?
- Can I write a minimal working example from memory?
- Can I name one common bug and how to avoid it?

## Mini Exercises

1. Write one small code example from this topic without looking at notes.
2. Modify one existing example so it fails, then fix it and explain why.
3. Explain this topic in 3-5 lines as if teaching a beginner.
