# JavaScript Arrays - Track Notes

Track: **14 JavaScript Arrays**

## How To Use This Track

1. Start with basics (creation, indexing, length)
2. Learn method categories:
   - transformation (`map`, `filter`)
   - accumulation (`reduce`)
   - mutation (`push`, `pop`, `sort`, `splice`)
3. Practice search/sort/iteration patterns
4. Revisit const-array behavior and references

## Golden Rules

- Arrays are zero-indexed.
- Not all methods mutate the original array.
- Read method docs before chaining.
- Prefer clear, small steps before advanced chaining.

## Debug Mindset

When output looks wrong, inspect:

- current array value
- method return value
- whether original array changed
## Learning Path

- Prerequisite: **Array Basics**
- Next Topic: **Array Methods (or next section in this track)**

## Mini Exercises

1. Pick one array method and explain whether it mutates the original array.
2. Rewrite one array example using a different method (`map` vs `forEach`, etc.).
3. Create a small array challenge and solve it in two ways.
