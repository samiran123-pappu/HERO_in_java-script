# JavaScript bind() Method

Track: **09 JavaScript Functions**

## Core Idea

- Functions encapsulate logic and make code reusable, testable, and easier to maintain.
- Parameters are names in definition; arguments are actual values in calls.

## Syntax Patterns

- Declaration: `function add(a,b){ return a+b; }`.
- Expression/arrow: `const add = (a,b) => a + b`.

## Common Mistakes

- Forgetting `return`, or confusing function reference (`fn`) with invocation (`fn()`).

- Open the `.html` file and compare visible output with your prediction.
- Change one line and rerun to observe cause/effect clearly.
