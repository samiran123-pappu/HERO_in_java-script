# JavaScript call() Method

Track: **09 JavaScript Functions**

## Core Idea

Functions package reusable behavior with explicit inputs/outputs.

## Deep Explanation

Good function boundaries make code testable and maintainable.

## Worked Example

```js
function multiply(a,b){ return a*b; }
const result = multiply(4,5);
```

## Common Mistakes

Forgetting return and losing `this` context in callbacks.

## Real-World Use

Functions are central to modules, events, and async workflows.

## How To Study This Topic

- Predict output before running.
- Compare `.js` and `.html` behavior.
- Change one line and explain the result.
- Reduce failures to smallest reproducible snippet.

## Quick Self-Check

- Can I explain this concept clearly?
- Can I code a minimal example from memory?
- Can I identify one bug pattern and fix?
