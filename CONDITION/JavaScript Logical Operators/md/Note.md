# JavaScript Logical Operators

Logical operators combine or invert conditions.

## Operators
- `&&` AND
- `||` OR
- `!` NOT
- `??` nullish coalescing (null or undefined fallback)

## VIP Points
- `&&` needs both sides true.
- `||` needs at least one side true.
- `!` flips true/false.
- `??` is different from `||` for `0`, `""`, and `false`.
