# JavaScript Syntax

Syntax rules define how JavaScript programs are written.

## Key Parts
- literals (numbers, strings)
- variables (`let`, `const`)
- identifiers and naming rules
- operators and expressions
- case sensitivity
- camelCase naming

## VIP Points
- Keywords are case-sensitive (`let` is valid, `LET` is not).
- Identifiers cannot use reserved words.
- Prefer lower camelCase for variable names.
- Use readable spacing around operators.
