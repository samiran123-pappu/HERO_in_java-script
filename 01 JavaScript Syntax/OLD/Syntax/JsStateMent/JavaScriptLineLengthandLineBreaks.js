// JavaScript Line Length and Line Breaks
// For best readability, programmers often like to avoid code lines longer than 80 characters.

// If a JavaScript statement does not fit on one line, the best place to break it is after an operator:

document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
"Hello Dolly!";
