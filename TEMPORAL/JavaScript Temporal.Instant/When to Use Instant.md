# When to Use Instant
```bash
When storing timestamps in a database.

When comparing exact moments in time.

When working with logs or events.

When you need a UTC-based value.

Use Instant when you care about the exact moment, not how it looks in a time zone.
```

# Summary
```bash
Temporal.Instant represents an exact UTC moment in time.

It replaces timestamp usage with Date and provides clearer and safer comparisons.
