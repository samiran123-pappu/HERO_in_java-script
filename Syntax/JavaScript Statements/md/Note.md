# JavaScript Statements

A program is a sequence of statements executed in order.

## Statement Building Blocks
- values
- operators
- expressions
- keywords
- comments

## Important Formatting
- semicolons are recommended
- keep line lengths readable
- break long lines after operators
- use code blocks `{}` for grouped logic

## VIP Points
- Multiple statements can be on one line, but readability is lower.
- Use consistent indentation in code blocks.
