// JavaScript Array toSpliced()
// ES2023 added the Array toSpliced() method as a safe way to splice an array without altering the original array.

// The difference between the new toSpliced() method and the old splice() method is that the new method creates a new array, keeping the original array unchanged, while the old method altered the original array.

// Example
const months = ["Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr"];
let a = months.toSpliced(0, 1);
console.log(months);
console.log(a);
