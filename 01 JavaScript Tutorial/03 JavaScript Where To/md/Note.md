# JavaScript Where To

Track: **01 JavaScript Tutorial**

## Core Idea

- Syntax and statements are the grammar of JavaScript programs.
- Clean formatting, comments, and predictable output methods improve learning speed.

## Syntax Patterns

- Prefer `let`/`const`, semicolons consistently, and readable line breaks.
- Use `innerHTML`/`innerText` for visible output and `console.log` for debugging.

## Common Mistakes

- Mixing output styles randomly and skipping readability conventions.

## How To Study This Topic

- Read the HTML example heading and predict the expected result first.
- Run the `.js` file and verify each variable/value transition.
- Open the `.html` file and compare visible output with your prediction.
- Change one line and rerun to observe cause/effect clearly.

## Quick Self-Check
