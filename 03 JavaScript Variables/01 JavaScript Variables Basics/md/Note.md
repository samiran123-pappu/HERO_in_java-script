# JavaScript Variables Basics

Track: **03 JavaScript Variables**

## Core Idea

Variables are named containers for data. You read/write values through those names while your program runs.

- `let` for values that can change
- `const` for values that should not be reassigned
- avoid `var` in modern learning code

## Naming Rules

- Start with letter, `_`, or `$`
- Case-sensitive (`score` and `Score` are different)
- Avoid reserved keywords (`if`, `const`, `class`, etc.)

## Common Beginner Confusion

`=` means assignment, not comparison.

```js
let x = 5;    // assign
x == 5;       // compare
x === 5;      // strict compare
```

## Quick Check

- Can you explain when to use `let` vs `const`?
- Can you name 2 valid and 2 invalid variable names?

## Mini Exercises

1. Write one small code example from this topic without looking at notes.
2. Modify one existing example so it fails, then fix it and explain why.
3. Explain this topic in 3-5 lines as if teaching a beginner.
