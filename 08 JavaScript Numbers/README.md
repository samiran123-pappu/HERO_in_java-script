# 08 JavaScript Numbers

## One Type to Rule Them All

Unlike many other programming languages, JavaScript has only one type of number. Numbers can be written with or without decimals.

## 📚 Topics

1.  **[01 Number Basics](./01%20JavaScript%20Number%20Basics/index.html)**
    *   Integers and Floats.
    *   Scientific notation (`123e5`).
    *   Floating point precision issues (`0.1 + 0.2`).

2.  **02 Number Methods**
    *   Formatting numbers (`toFixed`, `toPrecision`).
    *   Converting to strings (`toString`).
    *   Parsing strings to numbers (`parseInt`, `parseFloat`).

3.  **03 Number Properties**
    *   Constants like `MAX_VALUE` and `MIN_VALUE`.
    *   `NaN` (Not a Number) and `Infinity`.

## 🔑 Key Takeaway

- JavaScript numbers are always 64-bit Floating Point.
- Be careful with decimal math (e.g., `0.1 + 0.2 !== 0.3`).
- `NaN` is a special value meaning "Not a Number" (result of invalid math).
