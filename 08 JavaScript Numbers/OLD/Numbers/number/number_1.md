Number systems (bases) used in code

Binary (base 2): digits 0,1. Used by computers internally.
Octal (base 8): digits 0–7. Rare now, sometimes in permissions (chmod 755).
Decimal (base 10): digits 0–9. Normal human numbers.
Hex (base 16): digits 0–9, A–F. Very common for colors, memory, IDs.
Hex in HTML colors

#RRGGBB is hex.
Example: #FF0000 = red, #00FF00 = green, #0000FF = blue.
Regex is not a number system

Regex is a text pattern tool (e.g., /\d+/ finds digits).
