# JavaScript Conditionals

Conditional statements run different code depending on whether a condition is true or false.

## Main Types
- `if`
- `if...else`
- `if...else if...else`
- `switch`
- ternary `? :`

## When to Use
- Use `if` for one condition.
- Use `if...else` for two possible outcomes.
- Use `else if` when checking multiple ranges/conditions.
- Use `switch` when comparing one value against many exact cases.
- Use ternary for short value selection.

## VIP Points
- Conditions are usually comparisons (`>`, `<`, `===`, etc.).
- `switch` uses strict comparison (`===`).
- Keep conditions readable; avoid deeply nested blocks when possible.
