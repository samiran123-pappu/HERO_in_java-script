# JavaScript Operator Reference

Track: **04 JavaScript Operators**

## Quick List

- Arithmetic: `+ - * / % ** ++ --`
- Assignment: `= += -= *= /= %= **= &&= ||= ??=`
- Comparison: `== === != !== > < >= <=`
- Logical: `&& || !`

## Practical Rules

1. Prefer strict comparisons (`===`, `!==`)
2. Use parentheses for readable precedence
3. Use compound assignment when it improves clarity
4. Be explicit with type conversion when comparing
## Learning Path
