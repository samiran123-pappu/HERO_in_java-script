# JavaScript Operators Basics

Operators are symbols used for mathematical and logical computation.

Main groups:

- Arithmetic (`+ - * / % ** ++ --`)
- Assignment (`= += -= *= /= %= **=`)
- Comparison (`== === != !== > < >= <=`)
- Logical (`&& || !`)

`+` is used for both addition and string concatenation.
When you add a number and a string, JavaScript returns a string.
