# JavaScript Operators Basics

Track: **04 JavaScript Operators**

## Core Idea

Operators are symbols that perform actions on values.

- Arithmetic (`+ - * / % **`)
- Assignment (`= += -= ...`)
- Comparison (`== === > < ...`)
- Logical (`&& || !`)

## Key Behavior

`+` can add numbers or concatenate strings.

```js
5 + 5;   // 10
"5" + 5; // "55"
```

## Quick Check

- Can you tell assignment from comparison quickly?
- Can you predict result types when strings are involved?

## Mini Exercises

1. Write one small code example from this topic without looking at notes.
2. Modify one existing example so it fails, then fix it and explain why.
3. Explain this topic in 3-5 lines as if teaching a beginner.
