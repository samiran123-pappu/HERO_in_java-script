# JavaScript Assignment Operators

Track: **04 JavaScript Operators**

## Core Idea

- Assignment updates a variable value and stores the result back in that variable.
- Compound assignment is shorthand and improves readability once you understand it.

## Syntax Patterns

- `x += y` is exactly `x = x + y`.
- `x ||= y` assigns only when `x` is falsy; `x ??= y` assigns only when `x` is null/undefined.

## Common Mistakes

- Mixing `||=` and `??=` incorrectly when `0`, `false`, or empty string are valid values.

## How To Study This Topic

- Read the HTML example heading and predict the expected result first.
- Run the `.js` file and verify each variable/value transition.
- Open the `.html` file and compare visible output with your prediction.
- Change one line and rerun to observe cause/effect clearly.
