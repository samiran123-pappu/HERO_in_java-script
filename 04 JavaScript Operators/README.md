# 04 JavaScript Operators

## Performing Actions on Data

Operators are symbols that tell the compiler or interpreter to perform specific mathematical, relational, or logical manipulations.

## 📚 Topics

1.  **[01 Arithmetic](./01%20Arithmetic/index.html)**
    *   Math operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `++`, `--`.
    *   Operator precedence.

2.  **02 Assignment**
    *   Assigning values: `=`, `+=`, `-=`.
    *   Modern operators: `**=`, `&&=`.

3.  **03 Comparison**
    *   Testing equality: `==` vs `===`.
    *   Greater than, less than.

4.  **04 Logical**
    *   Boolean logic: `&&` (AND), `||` (OR), `!` (NOT).
    *   Short-circuit evaluation.

5.  **05 Typeof**
    *   Checking data types at runtime.
    *   Understanding `typeof null` (the famous bug).

## 🔑 Key Takeaway

- Always use strict equality `===` to avoid type coercion bugs.
- Understand the difference between `x++` and `++x`.
- Logical operators can return non-boolean values (e.g., `val || default`).
