# JavaScript String Reference

Track: **07 JavaScript Strings**

## Core Idea

Strings are immutable text values; methods return new strings.

## Deep Explanation

Template literals and search/transform methods are core text tools.

## Worked Example

```js
const name = "Sam";
const msg = `Hello, ${name}`;
```

## Common Mistakes

Expecting in-place mutation from methods like `replace`.

## Real-World Use

String handling appears in forms, logs, URLs, and UI messages.
