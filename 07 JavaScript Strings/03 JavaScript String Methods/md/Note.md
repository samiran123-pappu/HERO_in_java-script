# JavaScript String Methods

Track: **07 JavaScript Strings**

## Core Idea

- Strings are immutable. Methods return new strings instead of editing the original.
- Template literals improve readability for interpolation and multi-line text.

## Syntax Patterns

- Use backticks and `${...}` for interpolation.
- Common methods: `slice`, `replace`, `split`, `trim`, `includes`, `startsWith`, `endsWith`.

## Common Mistakes

- Confusing string index behavior with arrays, and expecting in-place mutation.

## How To Study This Topic

- Read the HTML example heading and predict the expected result first.
- Run the `.js` file and verify each variable/value transition.
- Open the `.html` file and compare visible output with your prediction.
- Change one line and rerun to observe cause/effect clearly.

## Quick Self-Check
