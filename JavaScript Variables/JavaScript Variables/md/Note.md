# JavaScript Variables

Variables are containers for storing data.

## Declaration Ways
- `let` (modern)
- `const` (modern)
- `var` (older, not recommended for new code)
- implicit/global assignment (not recommended)

## Identifier Rules
- starts with letter, `_`, or `$`
- may include digits after first character
- case-sensitive
- cannot use reserved keywords

## VIP Points
- Prefer `const` by default.
- Use `let` only when reassignment is needed.
- Avoid undeclared variables.
