// JavaScript Let
// The let keyword was introduced in ES6 (2015)

// Variables declared with let have Block Scope

// Variables declared with let must be Declared before use

// Variables declared with let cannot be Redeclared in the same scope

// Block Scope
// Before ES6 (2015), JavaScript did not have Block Scope.

// JavaScript had Global Scope and Function Scope.

// ES6 introduced the two new JavaScript keywords: let and const.

// These two keywords provided Block Scope in JavaScript:

// Example
// Variables declared inside a { } block cannot be accessed from outside the block:

{
  let x = 2;
}
// x can NOT be used here

// Function Scope
// Inside a function all variables declared with var, let or const have Function Scope:

// Example
function myfunction() {
  var x = 1;
  let y = 2;
  const z = 3;
}
//x can NOT be used here
//y can NOT be used here
//z can NOT be used here

// Global Scope
// Variables declared with the var always have Global Scope.

// Variables declared with the var keyword can NOT have block scope:

// Example
// Variables declared with varinside a { } block can be accessed from outside the block:

{
  var x = 2;
}
// x CAN be used here

// Cannot be Redeclared
// Variables defined with let can not be redeclared.

// You can not accidentally redeclare a variable declared with let.

// With let you can not do this:

let x = "John Doe";

let x = 0; //wrong
// Variables defined with var can be redeclared.

// With var you can do this:

var x = "John Doe";

var x = 0;

// Redeclaring Variables
// Redeclaring a variable using the var keyword can impose problems.

// Redeclaring a variable inside a block will also redeclare the variable outside the block:

// Example
var x = 10;
// Here x is 10

{
  var x = 2;
  // Here x is 2
}

// Here x is 2

// Redeclaring a variable using the let keyword can solve this problem.

// Redeclaring a variable inside a block will not redeclare the variable outside the block:

// Example
let x = 10;
// Here x is 10

{
  let x = 2;
  // Here x is 2
}

// Here x is 10



// Difference Between var, let and const
//    Scope,Redeclare,Reassign,Hoisted,Binds-this
// var	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes
// let	Yes	No	Yes	No	No
// constYes	No	No	No	No
// What is Good?
// let and const have block scope.

// let and const can not be redeclared.

// let and const must be declared before use.

// let and const does not bind to this.

// let and const are not hoisted.

// What is Not Good?
// var does not have to be declared.

// var is hoisted.

// var binds to this.
