# JavaScript Arrays
## An Array is an object type designed for storing data collections.

### Key characteristics of JavaScript arrays are:
```bash
Elements: An array is a list of values, known as elements.

Ordered: Array elements are ordered based on their index.

Zero indexed: The first element is at index 0, the second at index 1, and so on.

Dynamic size: Arrays can grow or shrink as elements are added or removed.

Heterogeneous: Arrays can store elements of different data types (numbers, strings, objects and other arrays).
```

`Spaces and line breaks are not important. A declaration can span multiple lines:`
`You can also create an empty array, and provide elements later:`
```bash
Example
const cars = [];
cars[0]= "Saab";
cars[1]= "Volvo";
cars[2]= "BMW";
```
