// Arrays are Objects
// Arrays are a special type of objects. The typeof operator in JavaScript returns "object" for arrays.

// But, JavaScript arrays are best described as arrays.

// Arrays use numbers to access its "elements". In this example, person[0] returns John:


const person = ["John", "Doe", 46];
console.log(person[0]);
