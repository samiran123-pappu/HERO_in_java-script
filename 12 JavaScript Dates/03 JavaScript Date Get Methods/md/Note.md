# JavaScript Date Get Methods

Track: **12 JavaScript Dates**

## Core Idea

Date logic requires explicit parsing and timezone awareness.

## Deep Explanation

Prefer ISO formats and separate local vs UTC intent clearly.

## Worked Example

```js
const d = new Date("2025-01-01T00:00:00Z");
```

## Common Mistakes

Ambiguous string parsing and mixed timezone assumptions.

## Real-World Use

Scheduling and reporting depend on deterministic date handling.
