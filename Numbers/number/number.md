# Here is a simple, no-stress way to remember it.

# Number systems (bases)

### Binary (base 2): uses 0,1. Used by computers.
### Example: 1010 (base 2) = 10 (base 10)
### Decimal (base 10): uses 0-9. Normal counting.
### Example: 10 (base 10)
### Hex (base 16): uses 0-9 and A-F. Compact way to write binary.
### Example: 0xFF (base 16) = 255 (base 10)


## Regex is not a number system:
### It is a pattern for text search. Example: /\d+/ finds digits.

# Bits and bytes
## Bit = smallest unit (just 0 or 1)
## Byte = 8 bits

# Memory sizes (easy mental ladder)
## 1 KB = 1024 bytes
## 1 MB = 1024 KB
## 1 GB = 1024 MB
## 1 TB = 1024 GB


## Easy memory trick
```bash
Binary = 2, Decimal = 10, Hex = 16
Just remember: 2, 10, 16.
```


```bash
Number systems (bases) used in code

Binary (base 2): digits 0,1. Used by computers internally.
Octal (base 8): digits 0–7. Rare now, sometimes in permissions (chmod 755).
Decimal (base 10): digits 0–9. Normal human numbers.
Hex (base 16): digits 0–9, A–F. Very common for colors, memory, IDs.
Hex in HTML colors

#RRGGBB is hex.
Example: #FF0000 = red, #00FF00 = green, #0000FF = blue.
Regex is not a number system

Regex is a text pattern tool (e.g., /\d+/ finds digits).
