# Here is a simple, no-stress way to remember it.

## Number systems (bases)

# Binary (base 2): uses 0,1. Used by computers.
# Example: 1010 (base 2) = 10 (base 10)
# Decimal (base 10): uses 0-9. Normal counting.
# Example: 10 (base 10)
# Hex (base 16): uses 0-9 and A-F. Compact way to write binary.
# Example: 0xFF (base 16) = 255 (base 10)
# Regex is not a number system.
# It is a pattern for text search. Example: /\d+/ finds digits.

`Bits and bytes`

`Bit = smallest unit (just 0 or 1)`
`Byte = 8 bits`

### Memory sizes (easy mental ladder)

# 1 KB = 1024 bytes
# 1 MB = 1024 KB
# 1 GB = 1024 MB
# 1 TB = 1024 GB


## Easy memory trick
```bash
Binary = 2, Decimal = 10, Hex = 16
Just remember: 2, 10, 16.
```
