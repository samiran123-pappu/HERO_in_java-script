# JavaScript Strings

Strings store text values and are written with quotes.

## Key Ideas
- Use single (`'`) or double (`"`) quotes
- Use backticks for template strings
- Strings are immutable
- Use `length` for character count

## VIP Points
- Quotes inside strings must be escaped or alternated.
- Avoid `new String()` objects.
