# 06 JavaScript Loops

## Repeating Actions

Loops are handy, if you want to run the same code over and over again, each time with a different value.

    *   Why we need loops.
    *   The danger of infinite loops.

2.  **[02 For Loop](./02%20For%20Loop/index.html)**
    *   The standard loop: `for (init; condition; step)`.
    *   Iterating over arrays.

3.  **03 While Loop**
    *   Looping while a condition is true.
    *   `do...while` variant.

4.  **04 Break**
    *   Exiting a loop immediately.
    *   Using labels (advanced).

5.  **05 Continue**
    *   Skipping the current iteration.
    *   Jumping to the next cycle.

6.  **06 Control Flow**
    *   Reviewing how code executes (Sequential, Conditional, Loop, Jump).

## 🔑 Key Takeaway

- Use `for` when you know how many times to loop (like array length).
- Use `while` when you don't know (like waiting for user input).
- Always ensure your loop has a **stop condition** to avoid crashing the browser.
