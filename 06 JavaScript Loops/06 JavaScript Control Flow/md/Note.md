# JavaScript Control Flow

Control flow is the order in which code executes.

## Flow Types
- default sequential flow
- conditional flow (`if`, `switch`, ternary)
- repetition flow (`for`, `while`, `do...while`)
- jump flow (`break`, `continue`, `return`, `throw`)
- function flow (run on call)

## VIP Points
- JavaScript is single-threaded.
- Async APIs allow non-blocking behavior.
