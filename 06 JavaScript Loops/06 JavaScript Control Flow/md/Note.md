# JavaScript Control Flow

Track: **06 JavaScript Loops**

## Core Idea

Control flow is execution order of program statements.

Default: top to bottom.

Changed by:

- Conditions (`if`, `switch`, ternary)
- Loops (`for`, `while`, `do...while`)
- Jumps (`break`, `continue`, `return`, `throw`)

## Why It Matters

Most bugs are control-flow misunderstandings (wrong branch, skipped branch, wrong loop stop).

## Quick Check

- Can you trace a snippet line-by-line and predict exact execution path?
## Learning Path

- Prerequisite: **JavaScript Continue**
- Next Topic: **None (last topic in this track)**

## Mini Exercises

1. Write one small code example from this topic without looking at notes.
2. Modify one existing example so it fails, then fix it and explain why.
3. Explain this topic in 3-5 lines as if teaching a beginner.
