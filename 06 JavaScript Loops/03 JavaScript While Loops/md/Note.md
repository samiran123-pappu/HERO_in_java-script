# JavaScript While Loops

Track: **06 JavaScript Loops**

## Core Idea

`while` repeats as long as condition stays true.

```js
while (i < 10) {
  i++;
}
```

`do...while` runs body once before first condition check.

## When Useful

Use when iteration count is not known in advance.

## Pitfall

Forgetting to update condition variables causes infinite loops.

## Quick Check

- Can you explain difference between `while` and `do...while`?
- Can you rewrite a simple `for` as `while`?
## Learning Path

## Mini Exercises

1. Write one small code example from this topic without looking at notes.
2. Modify one existing example so it fails, then fix it and explain why.
3. Explain this topic in 3-5 lines as if teaching a beginner.
