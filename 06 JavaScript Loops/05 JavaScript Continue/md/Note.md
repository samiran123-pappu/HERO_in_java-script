# JavaScript Continue

Track: **06 JavaScript Loops**

## Core Idea

`continue` skips current iteration and jumps to next one.

```js
for (let i=0;i<5;i++) {
  if (i===2) continue;
}
```

Unlike `break`, it does not exit the loop completely.

## Labeled Continue

In nested loops, labels can redirect which loop continues.

## Quick Check

- Can you describe when `continue` is clearer than wrapping code in `if`?
