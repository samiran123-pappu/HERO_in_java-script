# JavaScript Loops Basics

Track: **06 JavaScript Loops**

## Core Idea

Loops repeat code while updating state each iteration.

Typical use case: iterate over arrays or ranges.

## Main Loop Families

- `for` (known counter/steps)
- `while` (condition-first)
- `do...while` (runs at least once)

## Safety Rule

Always ensure loop progress (counter changes), otherwise infinite loops happen.

## Quick Check

- Can you explain when to choose `for` vs `while`?
- Can you spot where loop termination happens?

## Mini Exercises

1. Write one small code example from this topic without looking at notes.
2. Modify one existing example so it fails, then fix it and explain why.
3. Explain this topic in 3-5 lines as if teaching a beginner.
