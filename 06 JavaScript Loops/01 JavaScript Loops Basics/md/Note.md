# JavaScript Loops

Loops execute a block of code multiple times.

## Main Loop Types
- `for`
- `while`
- `do...while`

## Why Loops
Use loops when repeating the same operation with changing values (like array items).

## VIP Points
- Always ensure loop conditions can become false.
- Prefer readable loop variables and clear stop conditions.
