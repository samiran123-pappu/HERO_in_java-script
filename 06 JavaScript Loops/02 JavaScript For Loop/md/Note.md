# JavaScript For Loop

Track: **06 JavaScript Loops**

## Structure

```js
for (init; condition; step) {
  // body
}
```

- `init` runs once
- `condition` checked before each iteration
- `step` runs after each iteration

## Common Use

Index-based array traversal and counted repetition.

## Pitfalls

- Off-by-one errors (`i <= arr.length` instead of `<`)
- Forgetting `step` update

## Quick Check

- Can you write a `for` loop to print 0..4?
- Can you iterate array safely without overflow?
## Learning Path

## Mini Exercises

1. Write one small code example from this topic without looking at notes.
2. Modify one existing example so it fails, then fix it and explain why.
3. Explain this topic in 3-5 lines as if teaching a beginner.
