# JavaScript Object Management

Track: **10 JavaScript Objects**

## Core Idea

Objects model related state and behavior in one structure.

## Deep Explanation

Properties, methods, prototypes, and accessors form a major JavaScript foundation.

## Worked Example

```js
const user = { name:"Ava", greet(){ return "Hi " + this.name; } };
```

## Common Mistakes

Losing `this` and confusing own vs inherited properties.

## Real-World Use

Objects drive API payloads, app state, and domain models.

## How To Study This Topic

- Predict output before running.
- Compare `.js` and `.html` behavior.
- Change one line and explain the result.
- Reduce failures to smallest reproducible snippet.

## Quick Self-Check

- Can I explain this concept clearly?
- Can I code a minimal example from memory?
- Can I identify one bug pattern and fix?
