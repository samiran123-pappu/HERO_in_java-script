# JavaScript Object Getters Setters

Track: **10 JavaScript Objects**

## Core Idea

- Objects model related data/behavior with properties and methods.
- Prototypes, accessors, and object utilities are key to mastering JavaScript design.

## Syntax Patterns

- Property access: dot (`obj.key`) and bracket (`obj["key"]`).
- Iteration helpers: `Object.keys`, `Object.values`, `Object.entries`.

## Common Mistakes

- Losing `this` context, or confusing own properties with inherited properties.

## How To Study This Topic

- Read the HTML example heading and predict the expected result first.
- Run the `.js` file and verify each variable/value transition.
- Open the `.html` file and compare visible output with your prediction.
- Change one line and rerun to observe cause/effect clearly.

## Quick Self-Check

- Can I explain this topic in one sentence without reading code?
- Can I write a minimal working example from memory?
- Can I name one common bug and how to avoid it?
## Learning Path

- Prerequisite: **JavaScript Object Iteration**
